        My technical foundations are rooted in my undergrad college, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, India. Having actively participated in IEEE, Student's Chapter and volunteering in workshops gave me a strong grasp of Java, Python, and C++. The classroom courses built my concepts in Operating Systems, Database Management, Data structures, and Algorithms and my qualification in the Smart India Hackathon, 2019 gave me exposure to the world of Machine Learning. With these varied learnings, I  graduated as the Gold Medalist from my university with a formidable 9.2 GPA in 2020.
